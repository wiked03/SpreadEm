# SpreadEm

This is my attempt to make an fun hybrid app that will allow users to pick college football games against the spread and compete with friends.

this is an ionic app and is still early in devleopement.

to run it locally you need the ionic framework...

npm install -g ionic

then from the project directory:
ionic serve
